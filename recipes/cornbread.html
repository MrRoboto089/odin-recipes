    <h2>A Little History</h2>
    <p>
        I was never really a big corn bread growing up. But at somepoint, my mom (Nee Nee) began adding bacon to her corn bread. An let me tell you- it was <em>awesome</em>. So one winter a few years ago i texted and asked how she made it and she let me know. LIke a lot of her recipes, it starts with some basic ingredients (cornbreaad mix in this case), and she adds her own twists. Lets get started.
